## Real Time Chat Application
* Introduction:

In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital communication, there is a growing need for efficient and secure chat applications that foster seamless interactions. This proposal outlines the development of a feature-rich Chat Web Application that harnesses the power of Vue.js, django-notifs, RabbitMQ, and uWSGI. By combining these technologies, we aim to create a dynamic and secure platform for users to engage in real-time communication with enhanced efficiency and reliability.
